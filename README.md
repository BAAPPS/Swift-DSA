## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is my **dedicated Data Structures & Algorithms learning lab**, written entirely in **Swift**.

The goal is **deep, concept-first mastery** — not memorizing solutions.
Each topic is explored through:

* Focused implementations
* Pattern-based problem solving
* Clean, readable Swift code

This repo exists solely to strengthen **algorithmic thinking**, **time/space complexity intuition**, and **problem-solving confidence** for interviews and real-world engineering.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

* **Concept → Pattern → Problem**
* One data structure or pattern at a time
* No UI, no distractions — **pure logic**
* Emphasis on *why* a solution works, not just *what* works
* Swift-idiomatic implementations

## 🎯 Core Goals

* Build **strong DSA fundamentals** using Swift
* Master **common problem-solving patterns**
* Improve **time & space complexity reasoning**
* Create a **personal DSA reference library**
* Be interview-ready for **mid → senior-level problems**

* Problems may evolve as understanding deepens
* Refactors are expected and encouraged

This repository represents my **DSA learning & growth journey**, and will continue to evolve as I progress from fundamentals to advanced patterns.
